To create an Automator Service on macOS that allows you to select text, press a shortcut key (e.g., Cmd + O), and have the selected text passed to your Python script, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create an Automator Service
We will create an Automator service that gets the selected text, passes it to the Python script, and runs the Python script to open the file in BBEdit.

Open Automator:

Launch Automator from your Applications folder or search for it via Spotlight.
Create a New Document:

When Automator starts, select New Document.
Choose Service as the type of document.
Configure the Service:

Set Service receives to "text".
Choose "any application" from the dropdown. This makes the service globally available across applications.
Add the “Run Shell Script” Action:

In the left-hand Library panel, search for Run Shell Script.
Drag the Run Shell Script action into the workflow pane on the right.
Set the Shell Script Settings:

Change the Shell option to /bin/bash.
Change the Pass input option to "as arguments".
Enter the Shell Script to Run Python: Enter the following shell script that will pass the selected text to your Python script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Take the selected text and pass it as an argument to the Python script

python3 /Users/gsingh/PycharmProjects/bbeditpython/bbedit.py "$1"
Make sure to replace /Users/gsingh/PycharmProjects/bbeditpython/bbedit.py with the actual path to your Python script.
Save the Service:

Go to File > Save and name your service (e.g., Open in BBEdit via SFTP).
Now, this service will be available for use across the system.
2. Assign a Global Keyboard Shortcut
Next, assign a keyboard shortcut to trigger this Automator service when text is selected.

Open System Preferences:

Go to System Preferences > Keyboard.
Set a Shortcut for the Service:

Click the Shortcuts tab.
In the left-hand list, select Services.
Scroll down to find the name of the Automator service you just created (e.g., Open in BBEdit via SFTP).
Click on the right-hand side of the service name and assign a shortcut key (e.g., Cmd + O).
Test the Shortcut:

Select some text that matches the pattern in your Python script (e.g., [root@netbox2 (192.168.4.101) ~] cat .ssh/authorized_keys).
Press the shortcut key (e.g., Cmd + O).
Your Python script will now be executed with the selected text, and BBEdit should open the file from the remote server via SFTP.

Final Workflow:
Highlight the Text in any application that follows the format you need (e.g., [root@netbox2 (192.168.4.101) ~] cat .ssh/authorized_keys).
Press the Shortcut Key (Cmd + O or whatever you chose).
The Automator Service triggers the Python script, which processes the selected text and opens the file in BBEdit via SFTP.
Troubleshooting:
Make sure the Python script is executable and has the correct shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python3).
Ensure BBEdit is installed and available at /usr/local/bin/bbedit. If it’s located elsewhere, update the path in your Python script.
Test the Automator workflow by running it directly from the Automator app to ensure it works as expected.
